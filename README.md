# Project using Program R into research of structure accomondation base in Poland municipalities
The aim of the research was to examine and present the structure of the accommodation
base in Poland at the level of municipalities. Data accepted for the classification and typology
included the number of beds (for 2017 - the most up-to-date data at the start of tests) assigned
to individual categories of hotel facilities and the total number of beds in all unclassified
facilities. The source of data was the information base from the Główny Urząd Statystyczny.
The research tasks included: downloading and processing of statistical data to the form
enabling the analysis to be carried out; application of the data classification method
with the help of a hierarchical tree; classification (grouping) of municipalities according to
similarities in the accommodation scheme using a statistical program; analysis of results
and drawing conclusions.

The methods used and described in the paper are a hierarchical tree method
and the cartographic method. In addition, a statistical program (the Program R)
and a geoinformation program (the QGIS Program) were used to carry out the research in order
to process the data and their spatial visualization.

The result of the conducted research is the classification of communes into 10 categories
(grouping according to similar relationships) covering 1540 communes included
in the reporting system of the Główny Urząd Statystyczny. From the remaining 941 communes,
category 11 was created, in which (according to the data from the GUS reports) no beds were
recorded. There was no regionalization of particular categories, they are scattered throughout
Poland. In terms of area, the eleventh category is the largest category, followed by category 10
(only unclassified type).
